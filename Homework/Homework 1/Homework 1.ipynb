    "#### Chapter 1:\n",
    "##### Exercise 1 - Discuss whether each of the following are data mining tasks:\n",
    "* A. No, simply divinding customers based on a characteristic is not data mining. It's just querying.\n",
    "* B. No. Again, dividing customers based on a characteristic isn't data mining, but querying.\n",
    "* C. No, computing sales seems more like accounting than data mining.\n",
    "* D. No, this follows more towards querying in a specific order than data mining.\n",
    "* E. No, since the dice is fair data mining would not be useful here. Probability analysis or statistics seems more like it.\n",
    "* F. Yes, creating models based on previous data follows along the lines of a data mining task.\n",
    "* G. Yes, a model could be created to follow normal heart rate and use past info to determine abnormal heart rates.\n",
    "* H. Yes, creating models on past seismic waves associated with earthquakes.\n",
    "* I. No, this is just extraction, which is not enough to make this a data mining task.\n",

    "#### Chapter 2:\n",
    "##### Exercise 2 - Classifying attributes as binary, discrete, or continuous. In addition, classify as either qualitative (nominal or ordinal) or quantitative (interval or ratio). \n",
    "* A. Binary; Quantitative (Interval)\n",

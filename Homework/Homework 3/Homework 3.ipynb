    "{1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,2,5}, {1,3,4}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,4}, {2,3,5}, {3,4,5}\n",

    "\n",
    "From the list given above, the frequent 1-itemsets would then be {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, & {5}. The book mentioned that a candicate generation procedure is *complete* if it does not omit a frequent itemset and it does not contain duplicates. To ensure no duplicate candidates are generated, we must make sure the items within each frequent itemset are sorted in their lexicographic order. Since, in our case, they are numbers it will be easy to verify order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate Generation:\n",
    "1. {1,2,3} + {4} = {1,2,3,4}\n",
    "2. {1,2,3} + {5} = {1,2,3,5}\n",
    "3. {1,2,4} + {5} = {1,2,4,5}\n",
    "4. {1,3,4} + {5} = {1,3,4,5}\n",
    "5. {2,3,4} + {5} = {2,3,4,5} \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what was accomplished above, a walk-through example is needed. For the first frequent 3-itemset, only two of the frequent 1-itemset could be added to generate a candidate since they contain items that are greater than the ones in the 3-itemset. That is why {1,2,3} is matched with {4} & {5}. \n",
    "\n",
    "The frequent 3-itemset {1,2,5} is skipped because it neither of the frequent 1-itemsets are greater than its current items. The biggest 1-itemset is {5}, but the 3-itemset already contains 5 in it. Same for {1,3,5}, {2,3,5} & {3,4,5}. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the generated candidates are: **{1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,5}, {1,2,4,5}, {1,3,4,5}, & {2,3,4,5}**\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. List all candidate 4-itemsets obtained by the candidate generation procedure used in the *Apriori*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm uses the $F_{k-1}$ x  $F_{k-1}$, which only merges a pair of frequent (k-1)-itemsets if their first k-2 items are identical (lexicographic order included). Since we are forming a 4-itemset, the first k-2 = 4-2 = 2 positions must be the same in order to merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate Generation Comparison:\n",
    "1. {1,2,3} vs {1,2,4} - The first 2 position are the same, thus we merge the two. {1,2,3,4}\n",
    "2. {1,2,3} vs {1,2,5} - The first 2 positions are the same, thus we merge. {1,2,3,5}\n",
    "3. {1,2,3} vs {1,3,4} - The first 2 positions are not the same, so no merge done.\n",
    "4. {1,2,3} vs {1,3,5} - No merge.\n",
    "5. {1,2,3} vs {2,3,4} - No merge\n",
    ".\n",
    "6. {1,2,4} vs {1,2,5} - Merge. {1,2,4,5}\n",
    ".\n",
    "7. {2,3,4} vs {2,3,5} - Merge. {2,3,4,5}\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing this method to the previous shown in (a), only 4 candidates were generated instead of 5. These are **{1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,5}, {1,2,4,5} & {2,3,4,5}**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### c.  List all candidate 4-itemsets that survive the candidate pruning step of the *Apriori* alg.\n",
    "\n",
    "From my understanding, the candidate pruning just eliminates the candidates that contain infrequent subsets. So we begin to compare each of the candidates from (b):\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate Pruning:\n",
    "1. {1,2,3,4} - Check if {1,2,3} is a frequent itemset --> Yes. Check if {1,2,4} is a frequent itemset --> Yes. Check if {1,3,4} is a frequent itemset --> Yes. Check if {2,3,4} is a frequent itemset --> Yes. So this 4-itemset is fine.\n",
    "2. {1,2,3,5} - Check {1,2,3} --> Yes. Check {1,2,5} --> Yes. Check {1,3,5} --> Yes. Check {2,3,5} --> Yes. So this 4-itemset is fine.\n",
    "3. {1,2,4,5} - Check {1,2,4} --> Yes. Check {1,2,5} --> Yes. Check {1,4,5} --> No. This 4-itemset is out.\n",
    "4. {2,3,4,5} - Check {2,3,4} --> Yes. Check {2,3,5} --> Yes. Check {2,4,5} --> No. This 4-itemset is out.\n",
    "\n",
